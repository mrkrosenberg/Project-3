### User Research Interviews


We interviewed 10-15 people who were regular users of RTD or similar systems in other cities. Our intention was to determine if the problem this app intends to solve is real, and if people would actually use it. 

Here is our basic set of questions that we used to guide the research:
1. Do you use public transit?
2. How long is your commute?
3. How do you pass the time when you are on the bus/ train?
4. Would you rather do something else to pass the time. What would be the most enjoyable or productive use of your time?
5. What keeps you from doing that?
6. Why do you ride public transit?
7. Have you ever missed a stop? Why?
8. Do you ever get lost on a bus or train trip or have trouble keeping track of where you are?
9. Do you use any transit apps? Which ones?
10. How do you keep track of your stop? E.g. how do you know when it’s time to pack up your stuff and get ready to exit.

### Subject 1: Female, 34, Denver area. 
1. Do you use public transit?
  Yes
  
2. How long is your commute?
  By bus: ~35-50 minutes. By bike: ~25 minutes. By car: ~10-15 minutes. 3.5 miles.
  
3. How do you pass the time when you are on the bus/ train? 
  Duolingo! I'm learning Japanese! I also close my eyes & listen to books on tape, play games on my phone, and people watch.

4. Would you rather do something else to pass the time. What would be the most enjoyable or productive use of your time?
  I have to transfer, and waiting at the transfer point for sometimes up to 20 minutes sucks. I'd prefer a consistently 50      minute bus ride with no transfers over the chance of getting there in 35 minutes if the transfer happens to line up just right because it comes with the risk of a long, boring wait in the cold.

5. What keeps you from doing that?
  The transfer feels like super unproductive time, because it is an interruption and is much harder to Duolingo through. I'm pretty happy with what I currently have to pass the time when I'm on the bus. The transfer keeps me from doing that as easily.

6. Why do you ride public transit?
  Lots of reasons: > I like getting to use my commute in a productive way (learning a new language, catching up on my reading, even just shaking off the day and centering myself)  > It's less effort than running or biking  > It feels much safer than driving when the road conditions suck  > It's time to just chill with no other demands on your time or attention (like dedicated me-time)  > The variety of people you see, & getting to feel more connected to the community  > Even with the annoying transfer, it's reasonably convenient (shortish walk to/from ultimate destination, ok-ish frequency)  > One of the most important: my employer provides me with a free Ecopass. At my previous job, there were no transit benefits and I found RTD to be prohibitively expensive to take more than a few times a week.

7. Have you ever missed a stop? Why?
  Yes: I got sucked into whatever activity I was doing and didn't notice until we were pulling away from my stop that we'd arrived. This happens maybe 2-3 times a year.

8. Do you ever get lost on a bus or train trip or have trouble keeping track of where you are?
  Yes. In the winter when it's darker outside of the bus than in, and people's breath fogs up the windows so it's very difficult to look out to gauge where you are, and it's either too crowded to see/hear the bus announcements of stops, or the display/audio is not announcing every stop. I get frustrated when there is no audio announcement of stops (either automated or the driver). Every single stop should be announced.

9. Do you use any transit apps? Which ones?
  Mostly just Google Maps. I'l also use RTD's "NextRide" on their website on my phone, but I haven't looked into whether there's an app. I have both GoDenver and Transit on my phone, but I never use them. My current combination of Google & NextRide is sufficiently satisfactory that it never occurs to me to try something else.

10.  How do you keep track of your stop? E.g. how do you know when it’s time to pack up your stuff and get ready to exit.
  If I'm taking a route I take frequently, I listen to my internal sense of about how much time it should take, then I look out the window for visual cues, realize I still haven't memorized the landscape, and stare at the bus display until the next stop is announced. This usually happens 2-3 times before I see the stop before mine announced. Then I get ready to go for my stop.  > If I'm taking a route I'm not familiar with and am uncertain, I'll usually turn on my GPS and watch my location along the route indicated by Google Maps. Before I had this option, I would stress and watch the stop announcements and out the window with concern, obliterating most of the reasons I usually choose transit in the first place. Smart phones & Google Maps have made transit fun again.
  
### Subject 2: Male, 32, Lakewood
1. Do you use public transit?
  Yes.
  
2. How long is your commute?
  A few years back: 40 minutes. 
  
3. How do you pass the time when you are on the bus/ train?
  Reading, music and podcasts, mostly. I’ll catch up on news and blogs occasionally on my phone. 
  
4. Would you rather do something else to pass the time. What would be the most enjoyable or productive use of your time?
   Productivity/working on the bus would probably be better, but honestly, the bus became “me time”. A great time for a podcast. 
   
5. What keeps you from doing that?
  Lack of wifi/space on the bus for a laptop. 
  
6. Why do you ride public transit?
  Formerly, I rode public transit as my sole source of transportation aside from my bike. Now, I ride it as a cheaper alternative to Uber/Lyft for nights out. We also use public transit quite a bit on work trips. 
  
7. Have you ever missed a stop? Why?
  I missed a few stops due to confusion of routes at stations. 
  
8. Do you ever get lost on a bus or train trip or have trouble keeping track of where you are?
  In other cities during work trips, this happens quite a bit. Seattle is the worst with the light rail/monorail from the airport at SEATAC. Often find ourselves wondering what town exactly we’re in or where we’re at in relation to our hotel, etc.
  
9. Do you use any transit apps? Which ones?
  I don’t. But I absolutely would. Especially on travel outside of the state. 
  
10. How do you keep track of your stop? E.g. how do you know when it’s time to pack up your stuff and get ready to exit.
  In other cities, we roughly gauge when to move/pack up stuff for a stop based on the maps on the bus or light rail. Locally, it’s just learning from multiple rides.
  
### Subject 3: Female 42 New York City
1. Do you use public transit?
   Yes, MTA nyc subway
   
2. How long is your commute?
   Anywhere from 16-40 minutes on subway depending on traffic and subway problems
   
3. How do you pass the time when you are on the bus/ train?
  usually look around and think, I often pray or kinda meditate relax, sometimes check my mail or read the nytimes 
  
4. Would you rather do something else to pass the time. What would be the most enjoyable or productive use of your time?
  i would rather listen to a book and drink some coffee but I don’t like to carry a beverage on the subway is too crowded in the morning, and I don’t listen to headphones on the train because I like to stay alert to people and announcements 
  
5. What keeps you from doing that?
  See #4
  
6. Why do you ride public transit?
   I don’t have a car / fastest and only affordable way to get to work 
   
7. Have you ever missed a stop? Why?
  Yes, when I am deep in thought, or reading 
  
8. Do you ever get lost on a bus or train trip or have trouble keeping track of where you are?
  Don’t get lost anymore, but even tho I have been riding the subway for like 17 yrs I still reference a map a few times a week because it’s complex and there are always multiple combinations of ways to get to different locations. 
  
9. Do you use any transit apps? Which ones?
  Yes ITrans NYC & Subway: NYC, MTA train Times 
  
10. How do you keep track of your stop? E.g. how do you know when it’s time to pack up your stuff and get ready to exit.
   I listen to announcements and watch. Generally I stay engaged with riding experience. I usually know times between stops and get ready  to leave when I am about 1/2 way or 3/4 way to my stop from last stop:
